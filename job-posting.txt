Description

About Pinterest:

Millions of people around the world come to our platform to find creative ideas, dream about new possibilities and plan for memories that will last a lifetime. At Pinterest, we’re on a mission to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love, and that starts with the people behind the product.

Discover a career where you ignite innovation for millions, transform passion into growth opportunities, celebrate each other’s unique experiences and embrace the flexibility to do your best work. Creating a career you love? It’s Possible.

We’re looking for inquisitive, collaborative university grads to join our engineering teams. Working closely with product, design, data, and back‑end engineers, you’ll learn how large‑scale systems operate and play a meaningful role in building new technologies, features, and tools. Expect real projects, supportive teammates, and plenty of opportunities to explore ideas that make a difference for our teams and Pinners.

What you’ll do:

    Deliver code that is well-documented, tested, and operable
    Independently take ownership over the completion and quality of your tasks and project
    Execute scoped technical tasks end-to-end in collaboration with cross-functional Pinployees to help build the future of Pinterest
    Effectively and proactively communicate new ideas and opinions with candor as you grow both professionally and personally through learning and development opportunities

What we're looking for:

    Obtained a Bachelor's or Master's in Computer Science or related technical field by June 2026
    Ability to start between January 2026 and September 2026
    At least one year of programming experience in an object-oriented language
    Experience in previous software engineering internships
    Proficiency in a dynamic programming language such as Python
    Ability to demonstrate an understanding of computer science fundamentals, including data structures and algorithms.
    Strong communication skills and product sense
    Passion for Pinterest and the ability to manage ambiguity and continually learn from your experiences

In-Office Requirement:

    We let the type of work you do guide the collaboration style. That means we're not always working in an office, but we continue to gather for key moments of collaboration and connection.
    This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration [1-2 times per week] and therefore needs to be in a commutable distance from one of the following offices [San Francisco, Palo Alto, Seattle].

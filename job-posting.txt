Job Description

This internship role will be based out of Headquarters in Mountain View, California.

At LinkedIn, our approach to flexible work is centered on trust and optimized for culture, connection, clarity, and the evolving needs of our business. The work location of this role is hybrid, meaning it will be performed both from home and from a LinkedIn office on select days, as determined by the business needs of the team.

Want to work on advanced information-retrieval algorithms, massive scalability infrastructure + storage solutions, and large-scale applications for users on web and mobile devices? LinkedIn is looking for Undergraduate Software Engineering Interns who want to learn, grow, and work with some of the brightest technical talent in the world.

With the changing landscape of engineering, we are looking to help mold the next wave of engineering talent that will require data-heavy, platform and application skills. We're building the next-generation data infrastructure, including storage, streams, media and analytics platforms. Help us scale LinkedIn infrastructure to handle massive data growth across the LinkedIn ecosystem as we experience dramatic growth in membership and products. You will utilize distributed systems and algorithms and perfect your strong systems orientation skills (multi-threading, concurrency, scalability, performance). You will understand frameworks for caching, queuing, and distributed data storage, and be excited to work on cutting edge open-source systems.

Candidates must be currently enrolled in an undergraduate degree program, with an expected graduation date December 2026 or later.

Responsibilities:
• Scale distributed applications, make architectural tradeoffs applying synchronous and
asynchronous design patterns, write code, and deliver with speediness and quality.
• Develop multi-tier scalable, high-volume performance, and reliable user-centric application
that operate 24x7.
• Produce high quality software that is unit tested, code reviewed, and checked in regularly for
continuous integration.
Qualifications

Basic Qualifications:
• Currently pursuing a B.A./B.S. Degree in Computer Science, or related technical field and
returning to the program after the completion of the internship.
• Programming experience in one or more of the following languages: Java, C/C++, C#,

• Knowledge of core computer science concepts such as object-oriented design, algorithm
design, data structures, problem-solving, and complexity analysis

Preferred Qualifications:
• Experience working in a short-cycle, agile, iterative development team.
• Knowledge of computer science, with strong competencies in data structures, algorithms,
software design, and object-oriented skills.

Suggested Skills:
• Distributed Systems
• Operating Systems

As part of the application process for this role, after an initial qualifications review, candidates are required to successfully complete the HackerRank online code challenge.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the University Grad Software Engineer | Frontend position at Ramp. As a Computer Science and Engineering student at The Ohio State University graduating in May 2026, I am excited about the opportunity to join Ramp's mission to revolutionize finance teams through AI-driven solutions and contribute to building the future of automated finance.

Your innovative approach to financial operations resonates deeply with my passion for creating impactful technology. Having worked extensively with React, TypeScript, and JavaScript during my internships at JPMorgan Chase, I am particularly drawn to Ramp's tech stack and the opportunity to build performant, beautiful interfaces that solve complex business needs for over 40,000 businesses.

My experience at JPMorgan Chase has prepared me well for this role. Over the past year, I've modernized an internal financial tool by transitioning from an outdated JSP application to a responsive React frontend, designed to reduce task time by up to 50% for 1,000+ global legal entities. This experience taught me how to transform complex business requirements into intuitive user experiences while maintaining 99% uptime—skills directly applicable to Ramp's goal of helping businesses save time and money.

Additionally, I've demonstrated my ability to ship high-quality products through award-winning hackathon projects. At JPMorgan Chase's Global Hackathon, my team and I won 1st place out of 64 teams for building an internal mobility assistant using React, Python, and OpenAI APIs. We created a chatbot-driven platform with role-matching logic that exemplifies my ability to turn business and product ideas into engineering solutions. Similarly, at the Code for Good Hackathon, I helped build a React platform that engaged 1,000+ residents, showcasing my experience with cross-functional collaboration and customer-focused development.

What excites me most about Ramp is the opportunity to work on products that make a tangible difference. Your platform's impact—saving $10B and 27.5M hours for businesses—aligns perfectly with my desire to build technology that enables businesses to grow more by spending less. My technical proficiency in React v16+, experience with microfrontend architectures, and familiarity with backend technologies like Python and AWS position me well to contribute to your diverse tech stack.

Beyond technical skills, I bring a collaborative mindset honed through leadership roles in the National Society of Black Engineers and active participation in ColorStack. These experiences have taught me the value of diverse perspectives in building innovative solutions—something I believe is crucial for Ramp's continued success in the competitive fintech landscape.

I am particularly excited about the prospect of working in Ramp's fast-paced environment, continuously growing, and mastering my craft alongside some of the industry's best engineers. The opportunity to help establish engineering processes and systems that will scale the codebase and team aligns perfectly with my career aspirations.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my passion for frontend development, proven track record of shipping quality products, and alignment with Ramp's values can contribute to your team's continued success. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Christian Coulibaly
